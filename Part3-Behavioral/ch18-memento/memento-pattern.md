# Memento Pattern

Keep a memento of an object's state to return to that state.

Save a snapshot of the system state.

"Automatic Memento" is make use of destructor, and do opposite things in destructor.

Examples

- Git Control
- Playback system in UE
- Sparrow-Engine scene snapshot

the example code is not good enough this time I think.
